# **Plant Disease Detection System for Sustainable Agriculture**
The Plant Disease Detection System is an AI-powered solution designed to help farmers and agricultural experts detect plant diseases instantly through image analysis. Using deep learning (CNNs), this system can accurately classify plant diseases, enabling early intervention and improving crop health.

**FEATURES**
- **AI-Powered Disease Detection**: Identifies plant diseases with high accuracy.
- **User-Friendly Web Interface**: Upload images and get instant results.
- **Fast and Reliable**: Real-time image processing using a trained deep learning model.
- **High Accuracy Model**: Built on the PlantVillage dataset using CNNs.
- **Scalable & Customizable**: Can be expanded to support more plant species and diseases.

**TOOLS/TECH. USED**
- **Python** - Programming Language
- **TensorFlow & Keras** - Deep Learning Framework
- **OpenCV** - Image Processing
- **NumPy & Pandas** - Data Manipulation
